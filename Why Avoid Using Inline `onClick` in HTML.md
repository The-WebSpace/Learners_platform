# Why Avoid Using Inline `onClick` in HTML

Using inline `onClick` (or any inline event handlers) in HTML is not recommended for several reasons. These include security risks, maintainability issues, and alignment with modern development practices. Below is a detailed explanation of why avoiding inline `onClick` is a best practice.

---

## 1. Security Risks

### Vulnerability to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
Inline `onClick` makes your application more vulnerable to **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attacks. Malicious scripts embedded into HTML can be executed inadvertently if inline event handlers are present.

#### Example:
```html
<!-- Inline `onClick` creates a potential attack vector -->
<button onClick="doSomething()">Click me</button>
```

If `doSomething()` references user-provided data without proper sanitization, attackers can exploit this to run malicious code.

---

## 2. Separation of Concerns

Inline event handlers mix **HTML structure** with **JavaScript logic**, violating the principle of separation of concerns. Modern web development encourages keeping HTML, CSS, and JavaScript distinct for better organization.

#### Inline Example (Not Recommended):
```html
<button onClick="handleClick()">Click me</button>
```

#### Recommended Example:
```html
<!-- Clean HTML -->
<button id="myButton">Click me</button>

<!-- Separate JavaScript -->
<script>
  document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', handleClick);
</script>
```

---

## 3. Readability and Maintainability

Inline `onClick` handlers lead to cluttered and less readable HTML, especially in larger projects. By keeping event logic in JavaScript files, the code becomes easier to debug, test, and maintain.

---

## 4. Performance Concerns

Inline event handlers are directly bound to DOM elements, which can lead to:
- **Duplication of logic:** Repeating the same handler in multiple places increases memory usage and maintenance overhead.
- **Difficulty in debugging:** Debugging inline event handlers is harder compared to centralized logic.

---

## 5. Reusability

With inline `onClick`, event logic is tied to specific elements, making it difficult to reuse. Attaching event handlers programmatically promotes modularity and code reuse.

#### Example:
```html
<!-- Inefficient and repetitive -->
<button onClick="doSomething()">Button 1</button>
<button onClick="doSomething()">Button 2</button>

<!-- Efficient and reusable -->
<button class="actionButton">Button 1</button>
<button class="actionButton">Button 2</button>

<script>
  const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('.actionButton');
  buttons.forEach(button => button.addEventListener('click', doSomething));
</script>
```

---

## 6. Modern Development Practices

Frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular abstract event handling into components or directives, making inline `onClick` redundant.

#### React Example:
```jsx
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
```

By adopting such frameworks, developers can maintain clean and scalable code.

---

## Exceptions

In small, isolated scripts or prototypes, inline `onClick` may be acceptable for simplicity. However, it is not recommended for production-level code.

---

## Conclusion

Avoiding inline `onClick` ensures better security, maintainability, and performance. Instead, use modern event handling techniques to build scalable and secure web applications.
